# Multi-robot-path-finding

[Multi Agent Path Finding] Consider a warehouse and a set of robots which pick up items from

designated places, deliver those in desired locations, and finally the robots go to the end lo-
cation. Assume that the warehouse is represented as a 2-D grid of size n Ã— m. Each location
(Li) on warehouse floor can be denoted by a pair of integers Li = (xi, yi). Each cell on the
grid can be categorized in one of the following ways (see diagram below) - source location (P1-
P3), destination location (D1-D3), temporary storage location (TS1-TS4), obstacle (black square),
normal (rest of the cells). Source & destination denote pick-up and drop locations respectively.

Temporary storage location denotes the place where robot can keep some items. Obstacle rep-
resents a location where no robot can move. Rest of the cells are considered as normal cell.

Let there be k number of robots and r number of tasks. The details of robot location and tasks
are provided as per the following table.

Assume that the a robot can move at most one cell (either vertically or horizontally) at a time
step, a normal cell can be occupied by at most one robot. Source, destination, temporary stor-
age locations can accommodate multiple robots simultaneously. Our target here is develop a
work schedule that minimizes the time to complete all tasks. You need to develop both optimal
as well as heuristic algorithms.

## Requirements
Pandas,
Numpy,
matplotlib

## Creation of input file
For this create a .yaml file containing the innitial and final destination of robots. If robots
make stop at n location in their travel, devide it the journey into n+1 journey(eg; journey: 
start-stop1-stop2-end ->start-stop1, stop1-stop2 and stop2-end). Give the obstacles and transition
points in the form of python tuples. 
Also mention the size of the grid map in the input file.
See input1.yaml for reference.

The output file will be produced in the form of an "output.yaml" file containing the path of 
travel of each robot and the time taken to reach their destination.
